# Game-of-Life

This is a Conway's Game of Life clone implemented in C++ with SFML.

I coded this on my own to better understand Game's Flow of Control and how a multimedia framework functions 
so that I can better appreciate when using a game enginer later.

It also helped me code better in C++.

Some key ideas in the project are: 
  - State Driven Game Design
  - UI and Logic Separation
  - Caching Font (Heavy Resource)
  - Event Interrupts Handling
  - Inheritance
  - Being More Modular
